Overview:In this project I will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem.  I will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. 

1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
```{r}
set.seed(19)
sample <- rexp(40, 0.2)
sample_mean <- 1/0.2
theoratical_mean <- mean(sample)
c(sample_mean,theoratical_mean)
```
The sample mean is 5.000000
The theoritical mean of the distribution is 4.253421

2. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
```{r}
sample_var <- (1/0.2)^2
theoratical_var <- var(sample)
c(sample_var,theoratical_var)
```
The sample variance is 25.00000
The theoritical variance of the distribution is 13.38

3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.
```{r}
hist(sample)
mns = NULL
for (i in 1 : 1000) mns = c(mns, mean(rexp(40, 0.2)))
hist(mns)

```
This distribution looks far more Gaussian than the original exponential distribution!
